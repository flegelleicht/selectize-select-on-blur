# selectize-select-on-blur

In this repository I play around with [selectize.jsâ€™](https://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/) event/plugin system. The goal was to find out how to make a selectized `input` element add the first result from the dropdown box to the items when the user clicks way (on blur).
