# selectize-select-on-blur

In this repository I play around with [selectize.jsâ€™](https://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/) event/plugin system. 

## Goal

The goal was to find out how to have a selectized `input` element add the first result from the dropdown box to the items when the user does not select one manually but clicks away (on blur).
